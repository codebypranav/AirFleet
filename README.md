# AirFleet
This project is related to my new, AI-enabled pilot logbook that can be used for anything from real life operations, to in-sim flights you're doing for fun. This project is just for practice and not meant for official use (maybe one day, but not for now).

You can run this on your local machine simply by downloading the repo, and running "docker compose up --build" from the main directory. Make sure you have Docker installed beforehand!
